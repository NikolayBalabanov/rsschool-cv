## Abut me

**Hello!**
My name's Nikolai. I'm from Belarus. I'm 28. I've always been interested in technology and I am inspired
by web development. A huge desire to develop and make the world a little better helps me move
forward. I have been learning the web for about a year, I like to learn new things, I am not afraid of difficulties.
I can make up landing pages and write SPA in pure JS, React. I believe that everything can be done better, and 
I am convinced of it every time.
